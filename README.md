# Ringlight

This is a ring light that fits into the original CHM-T36VA down-looking camera mount. It can be pushed in by about 8mm if the mouse-bites are rasped away.

There is a hole in the back that can be used to feed wires through.

There are two spare wires (white/purple and yellow) that run all the way from mainboard to head. They are cut short under the heat shrink close to the drag chain where the cable splits into wires going down to the drag pin and wires going to the vacuum valves and sensors.

On the mainboard the spare driver marked OT2 can be used to drive the light. This driver support hardware pwm.

There is a skech for a cone that can be made out of white paper, mounted in the camera holder and act as a diffusor.
